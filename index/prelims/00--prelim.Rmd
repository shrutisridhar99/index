First, my advisor, Dr Anand Jeyasekharan, has been incredibly patient with me, allowing me the freedom to learn anything I felt an impulse to learn. And while at first he very rarely discouraged going down new paths, he became quick to warn me against rabbit holes when he realized my inability to avoid them. His occasionally uncanny insights often lead me to wonder whether he's been hiding the answers all along.

My co-advisor Dr Patrick Jaynes is always willing to provide feedback on everything I write, however hopeless or trivial the draft may be. I very much appreciate his thoughtfulness in asking just the right questions whenever I lack the capacity for words. 

I must also thank the patience and ingenuity of anyone who's ever taught me. While I won't rattle off all of my teachers since preschool, I am certaintly grateful to every one of my teachers since preschool.
